* Make the source code easy to read.
* Always refactor before pushing. --NOTE: Refactor means code must be simplified and easy to understand--
* Only push the update if it is already working. Use another branch if a module is incomplete.
* Always check if a variable is undefined.
* Use Indentions.
* Align Curly Braces.
* Loops optimization. --NOTE: Create constant variable so as to prevent reiteration of codes--
* Database: Use Indexing --If module uses table(db) and has search feature, table must have indexing--
